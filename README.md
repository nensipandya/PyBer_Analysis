# PyBer Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Overview of the analysis
With the help of Jupyter notebook and Pandas, we can inspect the data, merge he data , perform calculations and create dataframe. Wecan profuce the publication quality figure, in order to tell a visual story with the help of matplotlib. In this analysis, we can perform an exploratory anlaysi and create visualizations using rideshare data , to improve rideshare services and determine the affordability for different city types.

### Results

The PyBer Summary DataFrame provides an comparison of PyBer's ridesharing services in three types of cities: urban, suburban and rural. The result shows that there is major demand of number of ride in urban cities ( 68.4%)  than suburban (26.3%)  and rural (5.3%) cities. Between January 2019 and May 2019, there were 1,625 rides in urban cities, 625 rides in suburban cities, and 125 rides in rural cities. The figure below highlights how percentage of rides in Urban cities contributed the most to PyBer's overall rides.

Similarly, there was also a larger number of drivers in urban cities compared suburban and rural cities. There were 2405 drivers in the urban cities, 490 drivers in suburban cities and 78 drivers in the rural cities. The figure below shows how percentage of drivers contributed in the PyBer's overall rides.

Since there was a greater usage of rides in the urban cities, the total fares was also higher in the urban cities than suburban and rural cities. The total amount of fare in the urban cities was nearly $40,000, whereas nearly $20,000 fare in the suburban cities and $4328 fare in rural cities. The figure below shows how percentage of fares for each city types contributed in the PyBer's overall rides.

When we look at the fare, then the average fare per ride in rural cities are $10 more than urban cities. The average fare per ride in the rural cities cost almost $35, whereas the average fare per ride in the urban cities is nearlye $25 and in the suburban cities is about $31. It may not be good market to ride in th rural cities, but it is the very good market for driver to ride in the rural cities. The averga fare per driver in the rural cities is about $56, whereas the average fare per driver in urban cities is  about $17 and in the suburban cities is about  $40.

The multiple-line chart "Total Fare by City Type" further supports the PyBer Summary DataFrame by providing trends of total fares in rural, suburban, and urban cities between January 2019 and April 2019. The yellow line shows how fares in urban cities totaled from around $1,600 to $2,300 from beginning to end during this five-month period. In contrast, the blue line shows how fares in rural cities totaled around $300 from beginning to end during the same time period. The orange line shows how the total fares in suruban cities fall in between urban and rural cities: around $700 to $1,300 from beginning to end during this time. The chart further demonstrates similar peak times in all these types of cities.
