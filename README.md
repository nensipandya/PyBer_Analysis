# PyBer Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Overview of the analysis
With the help of Jupyter notebook and Pandas, we can inspect the data, merge he data , perform calculations and create dataframe. Wecan profuce the publication quality figure, in order to tell a visual story with the help of matplotlib. In this analysis, we can perform an exploratory anlaysi and create visualizations using rideshare data , to improve rideshare services and determine the affordability for different city types.

### Results

The PyBer Summary DataFrame provides an comparison of PyBer's ridesharing services in three types of cities: urban, suburban and rural. The result shows that there is major demand of number of ride in urban cities ( 68.4%)  than suburban (26.3%)  and rural (5.3%) cities. Between January 2019 and May 2019, there were 1,625 rides in urban cities, 625 rides in suburban cities, and 125 rides in rural cities. The figure below highlights how percentage of rides in Urban cities contributed the most to PyBer's overall rides.

Similarly, there was also a larger number of drivers in urban cities compared suburban and rural cities. There were 2405 drivers in the urban cities, 490 drivers in suburban cities and 78 drivers in the rural cities. The figure below shows how percentage of drivers contributed in the PyBer's overall rides.

Since there was a greater usage of rides in the urban cities, the total fares was also higher in the urban cities than suburban and rural cities. The total amount of fare in the urban cities was nearly $40,000, whereas nearly $20,000 fare in the suburban cities and $4328 fare in rural cities. The figure below shows how percentage of fares for each city types contributed in the PyBer's overall rides.
